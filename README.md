# personal website! 

This is the repository for my website. 
Inspired by other people's personal websites, I decided to make my own- making a website would be a great place to learn some frontend, and perhaps web-hosting knowledge, if I choose to move off of git. 

access it [here](https://arcueun.github.io/website/)

todo i want to add to this page 
- dark/light theme 
- add header with buttons (maybe blog, cv, etc)
- http req support? i'd have to move to vercel
- visual hover effect 
- a blog page so u can see each title, click it and it expands to show full text 

omg today i learned what tailwind CSS and react js is. I am literally running myself into the wall lol, time to learn new things!
