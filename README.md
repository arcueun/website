# personal website! 

This is the repository for my website. 
Inspired by other people's personal websites, I decided to make my own- making a website would be a great place to learn some frontend, and perhaps web-hosting knowledge, if I choose to move off of git and maybe make a funny apache server thing to respond to requests (which is actually really silly)

nb: I've decided to leave my comments inside as a guide for me because I was learning about html/css/js. quite useful!
