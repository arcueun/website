# personal website! 

This is the repository for my website. 
Inspired by other people's personal websites, I decided to make my own- making a website would be a great place to learn some frontend, and perhaps web-hosting knowledge, if I choose to move off of git and maybe make a funny apache server thing to respond to requests (which is actually really silly)

access it [here](https://arcueun.github.io/website/)

nb: I've decided to leave my comments inside as a guide for me because I was learning about html/css/js. quite useful!
 
todo i want to add to this page 
- dark/light theme 
- add header with buttons (maybe blog, cv, etc)
- http req support? i'd have to move to vercel
- visual hover effect 
- a blog page so u can see each title, click it and it expands to show full text
